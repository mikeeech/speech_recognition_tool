# Speech recognition tool (voice-2-text)

## About
This app uses the Python **SpeechRecognition** library to recognize English speech input from the microphone. This is paired with a text-to-speech conversion library (pyttsx3) to playback what the user has said.

This is a part of a series of apps I'm trying to build/play around with relating to translators/text-to-speech/speech-to-text etc.

## Getting Started
To play with this app, simply import all necessary packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the command line. Then, launch the file by typing `python translator.py`.

The technologies used in this app:
1. SpeechRecognition - for speech recognition
2. pyttsx3 - for text-to-speech conversion
